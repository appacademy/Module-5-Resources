   "labeltext": "As one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations, China has artistic traditions dating back more than seven thousand years. From Neolithic ceramics to archaic jades and ritual bronzes, the arts of China's ancient past demonstrate technical sophistication, brilliant craftsmanship, and the frequent implementation of large-scale production methods, especially in objects created for the elite.\r\nEven before the widespread use of metal implements, Neolithic cultures in China produced fine pottery and carved jades, the most elaborate of which were buried in the graves of important personages. A belief in the afterlife and in the ability of deceased forebears to exert influence over life in the present world led to the practice of ancestor worship, especially among those in power in Bronze Age China. To appease ancestral spirits, ritual offerings of food and wine were presented in highly decorated bronze vessels; these vessels were later interred in their owners' tombs, along with numerous other grave goods designed for use in the afterlife. The demand for bronze vessels reached its peak during the Shang (c. 1600-c. 1050 BCE) and Zhou (c. 1050-256 BCE) dynasties. Jades used for either ritual or ornamental purposes were buried with the dead from the late Neolithic period (c. 5000-c. 2000 BCE) to the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). The creation of these intricate objects required the control of vast quantities of raw materials and skilled labor--something possible only for the ruling class. Bronzes and other tomb objects required for religious rites thus came to symbolize the power of the elite. \r\nDesigned as ritual objects, the works in this gallery are now appreciated both for their aesthetic qualities and for what they reveal about China's illustrious past, as it evolved from a series of Neolithic settlements to clusters of powerful kingdoms, and eventually to a unified empire.",

The cultures that produced the most remarkable earthenware (ceramics fired up to about 1000° C) tended to inhabit areas along China's major rivers, and by the late Neolithic period (c. 5000-c. 2000 BCE), two notable ceramic types distinguished themselves from coarser utilitarian pottery -- painted earthenware from settlements along the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and black pottery from cultures near the lower Yellow and Yangzi River valleys. Painted ceramics were hand-built, made of fine reddish or buff clays, and embellished with dark slip (liquid clay) to create vibrant, mostly abstract designs. Black pottery vessels were wheel-thrown, sometimes to the thinness of an eggshell, blackened during the firing process, and burnished to a high gloss. These delicate objects were impractical for daily use and were likely used for ceremonial purposes. Several Neolithic cultures also fashioned beautiful jades or hard stones -- usually nephrite, an extremely hard mineral native to China -- into ceremonial tools and weapons, ritual objects, or items of personal adornment. These jades were sliced, shaped, perforated, incised, and polished using non-metallic tools and abrasive crystals of even greater hardness than the jade itself, a painstakingly labor-intensive process that only the privileged could afford.",

Excavations at several Longshan culture sites along the middle and lower Yellow River valleys have yielded tools, ornaments, and vessel fragments made of bronze. Longshan black pottery vessels with design elements reminiscent of hammered metal also imply the influence of metalwork during the latter part of this otherwise Neolithic culture. Following closely after the Longshan period, Erlitou culture sites in Henan and Shanxi provinces reveal a complex, hierarchical society that produced bronze tools, weapons, vessels, and turquoise-inlaid plaques (such as those displayed here) of astonishing sophistication. The presence of such artifacts, along with the remains of bronze-casting molds at Erlitou, confirms that China had fully entered its Bronze Age by the second millennium BCE.",

     "labeltext": "One of the earliest forms of Chinese writing is preserved in the simple inscriptions on bronze vessels from the late Shang period. Integrally cast into the bronzes -- as opposed to being incised into the vessel after the metal had hardened -- these marks were usually placed on the interior wall or floor of a vessel; the lids of covered vessels had matching marks on their undersides. Shang inscriptions tend to be highly pictographic, with many resembling birds, weapons, or humanoid figures. The inscriptions are not always translatable into modern Chinese characters, but most are identifiable as the names of either the aristocratic owners who commissioned the vessels, or the ancestors to whom they were dedicated. During the succeeding Zhou dynasty, written characters became more standardized and bronze inscriptions lengthened, often commemorating an event in which the person commissioning the bronze was involved. Bronze inscriptions were thus akin to historical texts worthy of preservation and study.",

     "labeltext": "Although its popularity would not take hold in China until several centuries after its introduction during the Eastern Han period (25-220 CE), the religious teachings of Buddhism began in South Asia around the 5th century BCE, and by the 3rd century BCE, figural images with distinctive regional styles arose. Two grew to particular prominence, later serving as major inspirations for artisans in Central Asia and China. In the northwestern region of ancient Gandhara (parts of present-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan), artisans working in brightly polychromed gray schist or white stucco took their cues from Greek sculpture, creating figures with Classical facial features, thick curly locks, and heavy drapery. Gandhara was ruled by a series South Asian Buddhist Sculpture of Indo-Greek kings from the fourth century BCE onward and long served as an important artistic gateway between India and the West. Meanwhile, near the northcentral Indian city of Mathura, artisans drew inspiration from indigenous Indian sculptural styles, celebrating the corporeality of the body, which they draped in diaphanous robes that revealed its structure. Mathuran images were typically sculpted in mottled red sandstone quarried in nearby Sikri, and like their Gandharan counterparts, they were naturalistically painted. Visual elements drawn from both of these styles are visible in the early Chinese Buddhist sculptures on display in the next gallery.",

     "labeltext": "A highly religious and ritualistic society, the Shang established their dynastic kingdom in northern China around 1600 BCE. Their king served as the intermediary between his subjects, a powerful god known as Shang Di, and deceased ancestors that the Shang believed could intercede on their behalf. The extraordinary emphasis placed on ancestor worship and state ritual during the Shang dynasty necessitated the production of massive numbers of bronze vessels and ceremonial weapons. Specific types of bronze vessels for cooking, warming, or serving sacrificial offerings of food and wine were required for ceremonies designed to feed and appease ancestral spirits. Like their ceramic prototypes, bronze legged vessels could be placed over a fire for heating. Covered vessels protected their contents from spills or contamination. Ceremonial weaponry, such as the jade blades with turquoise-inlaid bronze hafts displayed here, were an important part of state regalia, as Shang rulers owed their domination over neighboring societies to their military prowess. Ritual bronzes and weapons were essential burial objects, for they represented the power and authority that the deceased intended to take with him into the afterlife.",

     "labeltext": "The architectonic form of this ritual wine vessel demonstrates the close relationship between technique and design in the casting of ritual bronzes. In ancient China, molten bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was poured into ceramic molds made up of multiple sections fitted together around a ceramic core; the space between the molds and the core determined the thickness of the vessel's walls. This technique, which allowed decorative designs to be carved into the mold easily, resulted in highly symmetrical vessels whose ornamentation was contained within spaces defined by the size and shape of each mold section. Each side of this rectangular wine container, as well as its removable roof-like lid, is bisected and bordered by flamboyant vertical flanges; they mark the seams between mold sections. The vessel is further embellished by four thick, beam-like projections extending from its sides. These were likely pre-cast and inserted between the section molds before the complete container was cast. Although vessels with this distinctive decoration have been unearthed in regions traditionally controlled by Zhou dynasty rulers, who conquered their Shang predecessors in the 11th century BCE, mold fragments for similar projections were recently discovered at foundries in the last Shang capital, Anyang, in Henan province. The precise period assignment of this piece therefore remains slightly uncertain.",

     "labeltext": "A highly religious and ritualistic society, the Shang established their dynastic kingdom in northern China around 1600 BCE. Their king served as the intermediary between his subjects, a powerful god known as Shang Di, and deceased ancestors that the Shang believed could intercede on their behalf. The extraordinary emphasis placed on ancestor worship and state ritual during the Shang dynasty necessitated the production of massive numbers of bronze vessels and ceremonial weapons. Specific types of bronze vessels for cooking, warming, or serving sacrificial offerings of food and wine were required for ceremonies designed to feed and appease ancestral spirits. Like their ceramic prototypes, bronze legged vessels could be placed over a fire for heating. Covered vessels protected their contents from spills or contamination. Ceremonial weaponry, such as the jade blades with turquoise-inlaid bronze hafts displayed here, were an important part of state regalia, as Shang rulers owed their domination over neighboring societies to their military prowess. Ritual bronzes and weapons were essential burial objects, for they represented the power and authority that the deceased intended to take with him into the afterlife.",

   "labeltext": "The Roman Empire encompassed a multitude of disparate peoples throughout the Mediterranean world. From the first century BCE to the fifth century CE, the inhabitants of the empire were connected by the material elements of Roman life--from the monumental (baths, amphitheaters, forums, and aqueducts) to the personal (ceramics, brooches, and household gods). Roman customs and visual culture drew not only on Greek traditions but also on those of the Etruscans, Iberians, Celts, Egyptians, and others who were united under Roman rule. In religion, native Italian traditions, such as the offering of anatomical votives, were preserved alongside newly encountered beliefs. Evolving practices sometimes combined the characteristics and functions of deities, such as the Egyptian Isis with the Roman Venus, who was essentially the Greek Aphrodite. Roman influence in laws, individual representation, coins, and decorative motifs continued into the Byzantine and medieval periods.\r\nEmbellished with the attributes of deities, heroes, and conquerors, the portraits of Roman emperors and their families were prominent on coins. Their statues were set up in forums throughout the empire and venerated in shrines dedicated to the imperial cult, which helped to reinforce the loyalty of the common people, many of whom would never personally see their ruler. Wealthy private citizens also commissioned statues of themselves, in some cases following imperial models, but funerary sculpture--including urns, sarcophagi, and especially inscriptions--was the primary medium for individual commemoration. A common scene depicted in Roman funerary reliefs, wall paintings, mosaics, and literature was the banquet, where the diners would recline to eat while they were entertained by music, dancing, or even physical contests. The luxury tableware left behind is a testament to the decadence of the Roman banquet, which has inspired artistic representations from the Renaissance to this day. ",

     "labeltext": "As the daughter of Mark Antony, niece of Augustus, sister-in-law of Tiberius, mother of Claudius, and grandmother of Caligula, Antonia (36 BCE-37 CE) was a central member of the imperial court and was only the second woman given the title of Augusta. This head is considered to be one of the most mature representations of Antonia (see coin 12) and may be a copy of the portrait carried during the annual games held on her birthday. The narrow band in her hair may signify her role as priestess of the deified Augustus. This bust was assembled from several parts in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, when it was common to restore ancient sculpture to appear \"whole\" and therefore more beautiful. The head and two sections of the bust are ancient, although from different originals, while the inscribed left shoulder and the hair on the back of the neck are modern.",

On the other hand, variations in the choice of alloy for the figural cast weight could easily have caused this difference.

The retaining pin and ring for the third hook, now missing from the crossbeam, are made of iron rather than copper alloy, as in the other two, intact hooks. Perhaps this was a replacement (using a tougher, longer-lasting metal, although one more prone to corrosion) after the original copper alloy pin and ring failed. As suggested above, the flat profile hook attached to the weight, with its different patina, could also be a replacement, although possibly an ancient one. Its flat profile and sharp bearing edge are appropriate for precise measurement, and it would have seen the most aggressive and abrasive use of all the components, explaining the need to replace it during the original period of use. The lead and corroded iron inside the empress weight are intact and appear to be antique. The weight exhibits the dents and wear that would be expected from use. \r\n \r\nThe weight was cast, but areas of surface relief appear to have been enhanced with a file after casting. The chains were cold worked from a bronze rod, and the hooks and the crossbeam were probably cast as general shapes and then cold worked to receive their final shape and surface detail.

The beam, with units of measurement inscribed on three faces, is calibrated for three different scales: one weighed objects up to 13 pounds, another up to 34, and the third up to 85 pounds. The steelyard would be suspended by the short hook (two of the original three remain) appropriate to the scale desired, with the commodity suspended from the hooks on the two long chains. The bust weight was moved along the bar until it balanced. The stylized image, with a simple diadem to indicate rank, does not depict a particular empress. Bust weights often represented gods, heroes, and emperors or empresses. Such imagery evoked imperial authority over weights and measures, guaranteeing fair transactions with a scale calibrated to official standards. The empress's gestures (holding her cloak and grasping a scroll) indicate her erudition and imperial wisdom.",

The motif of two warriors dying simultaneously, each at the hands of the other, was a popular image for ash urns, appearing hundreds of times. The fighters may represent Eteocles and Polyneices, the ill-fated sons of Oedipus who killed each other in a battle for the kingship of Thebes, but it is uncertain whether Etruscan artists or viewers would have looked for a specific Greek myth in the image. The winged figures on either side are probably Etruscan Vanths (death goddesses). The reclining man on the lid is far removed from these incivilities. He holds a bowl of a type commonly used to pour libations to the gods, and his luxuriantly curling hair and lounging pose leave us unsure whether he reclines on a banqueting couch or on his deathbed.",

   "labeltext": "Ancient Greece had its share of well-known painters, men named Polygnotos, Mikon, Parrhasios, Zeuxis, Apollodoros, Apelles, and Nikias. Ancient authors talk about their works, innovations, and rivalries, but not a single panel or wall painting by one of these artists has survived the millennia. Instead, countless small-scale images have endured in a sturdier medium: painted pottery. Painters of pots are not mentioned in ancient sources, and they clearly did not have the same prestige as their colleagues working on a larger scale. Some signed their names, however, and the products of workshops based in Corinth and Athens, especially, were widely exported. In modern scholarship, painted \"vases\" -- as they tend to be called -- have received significant attention, and rigorous connoisseurship has identified numerous artistic personalities. The large corpus of painted pottery supplies valuable information on the development of Greek visual representation.\r\nThis gallery shows major trends in Greek vase painting of the Archaic (600-480 BCE) and Classical (480-323 BCE) periods, including contributions by different city-states and the Greek colonies of South Italy. As in sculpture, the human figure takes center stage. Subject matter ranges from the mythological to the everyday. Although most well-preserved examples come from tombs, painted pottery was essentially utilitarian, and its intended function should be considered in any examination of the decoration. Many shapes belong to the symposion, the communal drinking party that was a central institution in ancient Greece. The imagery on the vessels would have expressed and shaped the concerns and identities of broad sections of the population, providing the modern viewer with a rare glimpse of how regular people saw the world. Coins, too, take us right into the midst of ancient Greek life, including industry and trade. In emblematic fashion, they speak to the individual identities of the city-states and how these could be reinforced by mythology.",

     "commentary": "Since symposia were restricted to male participants with the exception of female entertainers, such as prostitutes or hetairai, this image, which is in fact quite unusual, can be interpreted as a kind of humorous parody. Instead of a man reclining and consuming wine, as would be expected, the roles are swapped, where the woman, most likely a prostitute or other kind of entertainer, takes his place on the couch. The irony of this scene is emphasized by her participation in kottabos, where normally the man might be calling her name as he aims at the target, she instead replaces him, potentially calling his name. There are two holes at the top of the plate, suggesting that it was suspended, though where exactly is unclear.",

     "description": "On this plate interior, a woman reclines on a couch into a plush and decorated pillow. She wears a long tunic with fine creases done in diluted glaze with a mantle thrown over her legs. Her hair is pulled back into a dotted headdress (sakkos). She holds two wine cups, one rendered in silhouette held close to her body, the other in her extended hand as she plays the game kottabos. In a symposium (drinking party), this game involved the tossing of the wine dregs left over at the bottom of a cup at a target, sometimes as one calls out the name of his lover. In the background behind her feet, an empty pipe case hangs on the wall, suggesting that the pipe player is somewhere unseen in this scene, accompanying the party with music.",

   "labeltext": "The world's first powerful kingdoms arose in ancient Mesopotamia in the third and second millennia BCE, centered on the cities of Ur, Akkad, and Babylon. Monumental architecture grew with the rulers' ambitions, incorporating elaborate sculpted and painted decoration. Administrative needs increased with the size of the territory, resulting in complex systems of record-keeping and the thriving of a form of miniature art: personal seals with carved designs. Widely divergent in scale, architectural decoration and seals shared many of the same motifs: encounters with animals and monsters; scenes of courtly life, such as the banquet and the hunt; and the worship of deities. Timeless formulae recurred not only across media but also in different regions and periods.\r\nThis gallery presents objects from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the west to Central Asia in the east, and dating from the Sumerian to the Sasanian periods, from the third millennium BCE to the first millennium CE, with a special focus on first-millennium BCE Iran. The Achaemenid Persian reliefs on the right -- like the Neo-Assyrian example just outside this gallery -- are prime examples of art in the service of kingship, carved by sculptors whose individual identity mattered little. Assyrian and Persian royal imagery had a lasting impact, for example in promoting the lion as a potent symbol of power. Ideas of kingship were also expressed in coinage, first in Anatolian Lydia and the Persian Empire, and later, after Alexander of Macedon's (356-323 BCE) conquest of Asia, in the coins of his successors. Near Eastern inspiration extended to many other areas as well, from alphabetic writing and renderings of the human figure, to a menagerie of monsters. The mostly Iranian bronzes on display here show the importance of animal forms in ancient Near Eastern art, revealing the development of distinctive styles with varying degrees of abstraction.",

     "description": "Terracotta cone-shaped foundation nail with a cuneiform inscription, written in Sumerian, in the upper half of the object, just below the nail head. The inscription is written in two columns around the shaft of the nail; the first column is the one adjacent to the head of the nail. The nail was broken into two pieces just below the inscription and has been repaired. \r\n\r\nThe inscription commemorates the building of the Emush (\"Temple: Foundation [of the land]\") for the goddess Inanna (\"Lady of Heaven\") and the god Lugalemush (\"Lord of the Emush-temple\"). The latter is probably another title of the god Dumuzi, whose temple, the Emush, was in Bad-Tibira (modern: Tell al-Mada'in). The final seven lines also record a pact between Enmetena and Lugal-kineÅ¡-dudu, and may be among the first written evidence for this kind of political accord.\r\n\r\nThe text reads:\r\nFor Inanna and Lugalemush, Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, built the Emush, their beloved temple, and ordered (these) clay nails for them. Enmetena, who built the Emush--his personal god is Shulutul.\r\nAt the time Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, and Lugalkiginehdudu, ruler of Uruk, established brotherhood (between themselves).\r\n\r\nSumerian text: \r\n(Col.

All wear a soft cap covering the lower face and, alternately, tight-fitting riding gear or a long robe. This variety of dress is common at Persepolis and probably reflected actual diversity in Persian clothes rather than ethnic distinctions. The figures carry young animals (lamb, kid, fawn, and gazelle), covered and uncovered bowls, and wineskins. Are they servants with provisions for the royal table or cult personnel with sacrificial offerings? Are the buildings they cater to palaces or shrines? The motif was repeated on reliefs carved under different kings: note the more linear style of the later fragment on the right. This continuity was programmatic and allowed later rulers to enhance their own standing by aligning themselves with powerful predecessors.",

Shipped across the Atlantic from the vast mines of Central America, silver was used to craft a variety of sacred and secular objects, from cups and salvers to medals and coins. Between 1600 and 1850, silver objects also figured prominently in a wide range of religious and social rituals, from the communion service to the taking of tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gallery displays pieces of silver crafted for four of these rituals, each of which required specific forms and styles of ornamentation. Ritual objects from the religious altar occupy the left side of the cabinet. The center section presents elaborately ornamented dining wares decorated to elicit attention. Assembled on the right are exotic objects used in tea drinking, and in the rightmost section, one finds cups and tankards from Harvard's High Table, the exclusive area where privileged students and senior faculty dined in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silver on view in each section is linked by shared stylistic attributes and decorative motifs, pointing to the relationship between design and ritual. Between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries in Britain, the art of crafting silver was a culturally embedded practice informed by the ideological questions, patterns of human behavior, and larger debates about the power of objects that animated all of the rituals in which silver objects played a part.",

   "labeltext": "From its seventh-century origin in the Arabian Peninsula, Islam expanded outward with extraordinary speed, through conversion and conquest. Within a scant two centuries, it had spread eastward and westward across ancient cultural centers to establish dominions linking southern Europe, northern Africa, and southern and central Asia in the new faith.\r\nThe visual arts of Islam have been colored by a profound reverence for sacred texts, especially the QurÊ¾an, which Muslims consider the literal word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the Arabic language. As the primary vehicle for preserving and disseminating this text, the Arabic script was elevated to the level of calligraphy and became Islam's quintessential visual expression. Through its ability to state meaning literally, Islamic calligraphy obviated the need for a complex pictorial symbolism.\r\nOver the centuries, a wealth of decorative modes developed in Islamic art. A deep interest in abstract order is evidenced by Islamic contributions to mathematics and by the proliferation of geometrically structured vegetal and interlace patterns in art and architecture. Although Islamic prohibitions against idolatry discouraged the representation of living creatures for religious purposes, artists in various lands developed a rich repertoire of figural imagery to illustrate secular texts, to represent the personalities and activities of the court, and to embellish utilitarian objects.\r\nDespite decades of usage, the term \"Islamic art\" remains ambiguous. It is used here to designate works of art made by or for Muslims, or works of art produced in lands where the rulers or the majority of the population followed or follow the faith of Islam. This installation offers a glimpse of Harvard's holdings of Islamic art, ordered according to a flexible chronology: the early Islamic era (650-1050); the medieval era (1050-1450); and the early modern era (1450-1800). Selected to demonstrate continuity, these objects nevertheless speak eloquently of the cultural diversity in Muslim lands.",

     "description": "Among the more extravagant developments in Samanid epigraphic wares is the elaboration of Arabic script--occasionally, as here, to the point of illegibility. The inscription on this bowl is a compendium of the major decorative devices and themes that embellish these wares, including the dramatic elongation or extension of letters and their ornamentation with plaiting, arcs, loops, knots, foliate terminals, and interlacings that seem to spring from their middles or the ligatures between them.The most exuberant decorative devices occupy the upper zone of the inscription, that is, toward the center of the bowl. Underlying the proliferation of ornament is an essentially rhythmic structure based on repetition of near-identical elements. Occurring three times in the band, and dividing it roughly into thirds, is a complicated and additive form of the letter alif, the tallest element in the inscription. Each alif bears three loops on its staff and at its top deflects rightward in a foliate terminal. Its baseline stretches to the right and has been transformed into a split leaf, from which a tendril curls upward and rightward and terminates in another split leaf. The tendril in turn joins, or nearly joins, a curving and branching foliate outgrowth that reinforces the rhythm established by the alif. Less regularly spaced are three plaited ornaments that spring once from a ligature and twice from a closed rectangular letter. Small rosettes composed of four dots enliven the interstitial space of the inscription band and mark the center of the bowl. This bowl is well and thinly potted of a fine-grained earthenware. The exterior and interior are covered in a creamy white slip under a clear glaze. The flat and very slightly concave base is partially slipped and glazed. Only the interior is decorated; its brownish-black slip stands slightly raised above the surface, and a carving tool has been used to sharpen contours and to articulate the plaiting, twisting, and overlapping of the letters. The bowl has been reassembled from numerous fragments, with one notable loss on the rim.",

Sackler Museum, The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art, 2002.50.88\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the Samanids (819-999), potters obtained a white ground by covering earthenware vessels with white slip (colored clay particles in solution). They then painted designs with different-colored slips and fired the whole under a transparent lead glaze. Among their finest works are the so-called epigraphic wares, which usually reproduce in angular Arabic script a range of benedictory phrases and popular proverbs. More rarely, as here, the vessels record examples of Hadith, that is, sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammad's conduct was considered an important guide.

     "description": "With its pure white slip, precise calligraphy, and perfectly clear glaze, this deep-walled bowl embodies the finest qualities of Samanid epigraphic wares. Most surviving examples of this class of ceramics reproduce benedictory phrases or popular proverbs. More rarely, as here they record sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammad's example was considered an important guide for how people should conduct their lives. In the early centuries of the Islamic era, sayings attributed to and anecdotes about him were collected and analyzed by numerous authors. The large andcomplex body of literature that resulted from this immense effort is known as hadith. The outer inscription on this bowl is written in black slip and records a saying attributed to the Prophet: \"Modesty is a branch of faith, and faith is in paradise\".  The inner inscription, in red slip, contains a similar dictum credited to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's son-in-law and the fourth orthodox Caliph of Islam: \"Greed is a sign of poverty\". Because each inscription is written in a ring, the calligrapher inserted a single-word invocation to mark the beginning: in the outer circle, \"felicity\", and in the inner one, \"health\". This bowl has been reassembled from about fifteen fragments, with only minimal losses. The white slip and clear glaze completely cover the vessel, including its flat, slightly concave base.",

In the 1550s, Ottoman potters developed an underglaze emerald green and a bright red that yielded a powerful palette visible at a distance. These colors, along with the newly developed modular square tiles, worked well for decoration that covered great expanses of wall. Larger, single tiles were used to highlight architectural elements such as doors and windows.",

In prestigious buildings, panels of cedar carved and painted with complex designs were often employed to cover the wooden beam construction used throughout Morocco during the reigns of the SaÊ¿did (1554-1659) and early Ê¿Alawid (1664-present) dynasties.\r\nFor viewers glancing upward, the pattern may have seemed celestial, alluding to a divinely ordered universe. The interlacing geometric mode of ornament underwent intense development around the year 1000 in Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire. Initially applied to objects or parts of buildings with symbolic or religious value, the style came to be used for a broad range of structures and portable objects. Geometric interlace spread eastward and westward, but its decorative possibilities -- rhythmic and complex, yet austere -- found particular favor across North Africa from the late eleventh to the early seventeenth century.",

Rabi I, 511 (A.D. July 1117)\r\nLimestone; signed `Ali Ahmad al-Jarrad [or Kharrad]\r\nInscribed (Arabic) Every soul shall taste of death; and we try you with evil and good for a testing; and then unto us you shall be returned. (Qur'an, 21:35) \r\nArthur M. Sackler Museum, Gift of Sir Hamilton Gibb, 1963.18\r\n\r\nMany faiths propagate themselves across time and distance through texts that articulate belief systems and prescribe as well as proscribe certain behaviors. By contrast, the visual arts of a given culture sometimes reveal a different picture of how a particular faith is lived and experienced by its adherents. This limestone slab and the adjacent ceramic plaque do both: The inscriptions framing the top and sides of each object replicate verses from the Qur'an, Islam's central text, and the beautifully carved inscription in an ornamental Arabic script identifies the stone slab as a qabr, or grave marker. The turquoise plaque was probably created for a mausoleum. The various schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fikh) are unanimous in disapproving of all tomb ornamentation. As the many decorated tombstones and mausolea throughout Islamic lands demonstrate, however, this was a law sometimes honored in the breach.\r\n",

     "labeltext": "The Ottoman dynasty established the largest Islamic empire of the early modern era. At the peak of their powers in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans built numerous large architectural projects, especially in the capital city of Istanbul. Many of the projects were designed by the renowned head architect Sinan. Ceramic tiles were part of his carefully planned interior and exterior decorations. Working with court-supplied designs, potters in the city of Iznik created some of the world's best-known and most coveted ceramics.\r\nOttoman tiles of the early sixteenth century, such as the hexagonal examples here, are indebted to earlier Persian tiles in their colors and shapes. In the 1550s, Ottoman potters developed an underglaze emerald green and a bright red that yielded a powerful palette visible at a distance. These colors, along with the newly developed modular square tiles, worked well for decoration that covered great expanses of wall. Larger, single tiles were used to highlight architectural elements such as doors and windows.",

The Central Asian warlord Timur concentrated in his capital city of Samarkand artists gathered from a vast empire stretching from Syria to India. Timur's descendants ruled over a greatly reduced realm--parts of Iran and Afghanistan--but gained renown as patrons of the arts. The Timurid system of organizing artists into workshops in which designs were developed for the book arts and for dissemination into other media was emulated by later dynasties, notably the Safavids and Ottomans. Arising in northwestern Iran, the Safavids united all of greater Iran under their rule and established ShiÊ¿i Islam as the state religion, as distinct from the Sunni branch practiced in the surrounding states.\r\nCultural exchange and industrial competition increased in these centuries, both across and beyond Islamic lands. Responding to the courts' avid consumption of Chinese blue-and-white wares, Persian potters appropriated Chinese shapes, compositions, and motifs in their own works. In contrast, the colorful dish with scale patterns probably reflects the highly successful products of the Ottoman kilns to the west, in Iznik.",

     "labeltext": "Perhaps the most important contribution of Muslim potters, the application of luster to a ceramic surface was not limited to vessels. As early as the ninth century, this costly technique was applied to wall tiles to distinguish parts of buildings. In the eastern Islamic lands during the medieval era, the use of colored tiles -- decorated with luster but with other techniques as well -- increased in complexity and scope. In both religious and secular buildings, large surface areas came to be sheathed in brilliant ceramic revetments. The use of glazed ceramics for architectural decoration continued into the early modern era, culminating in the great monuments of the Safavid and Ottoman Empires.\r\nThe luster tiles gathered here would have been integrated into the decoration of buildings of the Seljuk-Atabeg (1037-c. 1220) and Ilkhanid (1256-1335) periods. Although the star tiles bear self-contained designs, they were intended to interlock with cruciform tiles in a grid. Three of the tiles feature inscriptions. The two large stars, which were probably intended for the interior of a religious shrine, reproduce verses from the QurÊ¾an in Arabic. The tile with figural imagery bears fragments of poetry in Persian, demonstrating the revival of Persian as a literary language in the medieval era.",

Each section contains a palmette-filled pendant. Around the rim runs an angular pseudo-inscription. Paired lines divide the exterior of the bowl into sections, which are filled with loosely painted scrolls. The twining tendrils and the palmette-enclosing pendants on the interior of this bowl are very common in Persian lusterwares.\r\nThe bowl is intact, and the quality of its luster is remarkable. The white glaze does not cover the foot, which the potter would have held when dipping the vessel into the glazing compound before firing.",

The arts flourished in many centers, and wealthy merchant and professional classes emerged. A dramatic increase in productivity and innovation and an unprecedented expansion of figural decoration characterize the arts of this period.\r\nA transforming event was the influx of Turkic and Mongol peoples from Central and Inner Asia. Most of the objects in this case were created in lands ruled by the most important of the Turkic dynasties, the Great Seljuks (1038-1157), and their immediate successors, the Atabegs. The Mongol invasions into Islamic lands began in the early 1200s and culminated in the 1258 sack of Baghdad. Eventually, the Mongols established their rule as the Yuan dynasty in China, the Chagatay Khanate in Central Asia, the Golden Horde Khanate in southern Russia, and the Ilkhanid dynasty (1256-1335) in greater Iran. The integration of a vast Eurasian territory into the Mongol Empire facilitated commerce and communication, bringing fresh Chinese inspiration into Islamic art.",

   "labeltext": "The Zhou was a powerful state in the region of modern-day Shaanxi province in northern China. It came to power after overthrowing the area's Shang rulers in the mid-11th century BCE. In an effort to establish its cultural legitimacy, the Zhou adopted its predecessors' religious rites; the result was the uninterrupted manufacture of the kinds of ritual bronze vessels and jade implements that had been the sacred tomb furnishings of the Shang elite. In the eighth century BCE, however, attacks by nomadic invaders forced Zhou rulers to abandon their capital in modern-day Xi'an, Shaanxi province, and flee eastward to present-day Luoyang, Henan province; they never again controlled a unified state. This move marks the division between the Western and Eastern Zhou periods, (c. 1050-771 and 770-256 BCE, respectively). The Eastern Zhou era saw a proliferation of luxury goods made of gold, silver, and lacquer being used as tomb objects, buried alongside the traditional bronzes and jades.\r\nBy the end of the Eastern Zhou period, ideas of the afterlife were shifting, and philosophers of the day inveighed against elaborate burials. By the Qin (221-206 BCE) and Han (206 BCE-220 CE) dynasties, as a belief in immortality took hold, both the structure and the contents of tombs began to change. Whereas Shang and Zhou tombs were essentially pits made to hold the dead and the items they would need in the afterlife, Qin and Han tombs were multi-chambered dwellings they could inhabit for all eternity. Ceramic replicas of vessels, architectural structures, domesticated animals, and servants replaced the precious objects (and living creatures) that had been interred in Bronze Age tombs. \r\nA protracted period of disunity followed the Han dynasty, before the country was again unified under imperial rule by the Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties. During the post-Han period, as China's contact with foreign cultures to its west increased, tomb sculptures began to depict foreigners and exotic animals. Known as China's Golden Age, the Tang dynasty was a long period of peace, prosperity, and territorial expansion, famous for its literary and artistic achievements.",

     "labeltext": "By the Eastern Han period (when the Han capital was located in present-day Luoyang, Henan province), Chinese potters had discovered the efficacy of using lead-fluxed glazes for their ceramic burial wares. As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects--mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports--are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",

The earthenware ceramics on display here date to the Western Han period (when the capital was located in modern-day Xi'an, Shaanxi province) and imitated ritual vessels with painted-lacquer decoration. Fired at relatively low temperatures, earthenware vessels are not fully vitrified and are slightly porous, making them less than ideal as containers for daily use, but suitable as burial items. Few colored compounds can withstand kiln temperatures without alteration; in order to replicate the multiple bright colors and dynamic designs of painted lacquers, mineral pigments were applied to earthenware vessels after firing and are hence \"cold-painted.\"",

     "labeltext": "By the Eastern Han period (when the Han capital was located in present-day Luoyang, Henan province), Chinese potters had discovered the efficacy of using lead-fluxed glazes for their ceramic burial wares. As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects--mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports--are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",

The high demand for luxury goods to furnish the tombs of wealthy nobles enabled numerous artistic traditions to flourish, resulting in an array of ornate artifacts from this period and the subsequent Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). Bronze vessels continued to be commissioned by the ruling elite during both eras, but the addition of gold and intricate openwork designs (here seen on the gilt bronze pedestaled dou and the small openwork pou vessels) transformed this previously austere tradition into a more decorative artistic craft. Jade containers made in shapes traditionally used for bronze or lacquer vessels (such as the three exhibited here) were the epitome of ostentation, as there was no better way to demonstrate wealth than to reproduce a luxury item in a more expensive medium.",

In style, form, and function, the earliest bronze vessels from the Western Zhou period were virtually indistinguishable from those made by the Shang, for the Zhou sought to legitimize their ascension over their defeated rivals by closely replicating the tangible symbols of Shang power. Before long, however, traditional Shang decorative motifs such as the taotie animal mask began to evolve, and new forms emerged, such as the confronting dragons on the inscribed gui food vessel (far right) or the elephants on the covered you wine vessel (near left) displayed here. Inscriptions on these objects expanded, from single clan marks to longer memorializing inscriptions, signaling a shift in the function of bronze vessels from purely sacred objects belonging to powerful Shang clan members, to status symbols commemorating the accomplishments of Zhou kings and nobles.",

Although in the earlier Western Zhou period, bronze was employed primarily for ritual vessels, weapons, and tools, during the Eastern Zhou era, it began to be used to make mirrors, bells, and chariot fittings as well. Bronze mirrors were polished smooth on their reflective sides, and their backs were intricately decorated with auspicious symbols or cosmological designs. Their reflectivity was believed to create light in a darkened tomb and to ward off evil. Chariots were vital for military warfare, and those of the powerful were fitted with ornate finials and attachments, which during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) were often inlaid with precious stones and metals. This technique was also employed with greater frequency in the casting of bronze vessels, revealing yet another shift in the function of such objects, from commemorative status symbols to more decorative vestiges of a ritual tradition.",

     "labeltext": "By the Eastern Han period (when the Han capital was located in present-day Luoyang, Henan province), Chinese potters had discovered the efficacy of using lead-fluxed glazes for their ceramic burial wares. As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects--mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports--are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",

In style, form, and function, the earliest bronze vessels from the Western Zhou period were virtually indistinguishable from those made by the Shang, for the Zhou sought to legitimize their ascension over their defeated rivals by closely replicating the tangible symbols of Shang power. Before long, however, traditional Shang decorative motifs such as the taotie animal mask began to evolve, and new forms emerged, such as the confronting dragons on the inscribed gui food vessel (far right) or the elephants on the covered you wine vessel (near left) displayed here. Inscriptions on these objects expanded, from single clan marks to longer memorializing inscriptions, signaling a shift in the function of bronze vessels from purely sacred objects belonging to powerful Shang clan members, to status symbols commemorating the accomplishments of Zhou kings and nobles.",

   "labeltext": "White marble and nude bodies signify Classical art unlike any other material and form. Centuries of collecting and emulating Classical sculpture established the notion of its timeless perfection. As awareness of other artistic traditions has increased and as modern and contemporary artists have explored radically different approaches, this notion has become more tenuous. The greater critical distance actually benefits our understanding of Classical art, allowing us to recognize its time-bound nature and inviting us to appreciate it on its own terms.\r\nThe ancient marble sculptures in this colonnade have often been seen as examples of Greek art, but they are in fact of Roman origin and represent an early phase in a long history of reception. Many of the Greek sculptors of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE praised by ancient authors--Phidias, Polykleitos, Skopas, Praxiteles, Lysippus--worked in bronze and in gold and ivory, materials less enduring than stone. Most of their sculptures are lost. What remains are numerous Roman marble statues in Greek style. Traditionally, these have been classified as copies of famous Greek works, but the creativity of the Roman period sculptors should not be underestimated. As they carved statuary for an audience that admired Greek intellectual culture and art, they went beyond simple copying, creating variants and new sculptural types specifically for Roman tastes and settings, such as temples, theaters, bath buildings, houses, and villas.\r\nThis gallery also includes smaller works. Representations of the female body across the ages provide a counterpart to the Greek preoccupation with the male nude. Coins with elaborate designs represent Greek sculptural originals. Several are signed, drawing attention to their artistic authorship, an idea that was more prominently expressed in Greek art than elsewhere in antiquity. Bronze statuettes illustrate the development of styles from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman times.",

     "labeltext": "Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin that has been used for thousands of years to make objects as diverse as sculpture and figurines, weapons and armor, and jewelry and tableware. The addition of tin and sometimes lead made the alloy more versatile and lowered its melting point; another common copper alloy is brass (copper and zinc), which was in widespread use in the Roman period. Although other materials, like stone, glass, and terracotta, were available, copper alloy items were valued for their golden sheen, versatility, and durability. The material lent prestige and beauty to objects like these statuettes, most of which would have been dedicated to the gods. Modern bronzes are often artificially patinated, like the Rodin sculpture in this colonnade. While ancient bronzes were sometimes gilded or deliberately darkened, the unaltered surfaces naturally acquired a red, green, or brown patina over time.",

     "description": "Represented in an alert position, almost as if stopped in its tracks, this wild boar appears to be facing an opponent, either another wild animal or, more likely, a hunter, such as Meleager. Its front legs are stretched out and the proper right legs are positioned ahead of the left ones. Perhaps the most striking feature is the ridge of long upright bristles running along the animal's spine, with a gap at the center of the back. The pointed ears sit high on the head, the front of the snout is turned up, and the tail is curled up above the prominent scrotum. Although eyes and tusks are preserved, the now pitted surface means that it cannot be determined with certainty if the animal's skin was once marked by stippling or hatching to indicate fur--or even a wound from a spear.\r\n\r\nWild boars are quite common in Greek vase painting of the late Archaic and early Classical periods, typically in hunting scenes that may reflect aristocratic pursuits of the time in general terms, or may explicitly show a mythological event, such as the hunt of the Calydonian boar involving Atalante and Meleager. In these scenes, the boar is often depicted in a pose similar to this statuette. In a number of vase images of the later sixth and fifth centuries, the boars are shown with the interrupted or at least uneven ridge of bristles on the back, which is a natural feature enhanced by stylization. Compare the band cup Harvard Art Museums 1925.30.131.\r\n\r\nBecause of the animal's strength and fierce defense, killing a wild boar proved the hunter's prowess, and a brave warrior could be likened to a boar, just as images of boar hunting could serve as the visual equivalents of scenes of warfare. In ancient Macedonia, young men did not acquire full adult status until after their first successful boar hunt. Representations of boars and their heads or foreparts were employed as shield devices and other decoration on armor. The heroic connotations and heraldic qualities of the beast made it suitable as an image on coins, for example on Harvard Art Museums 1972.173, a silver didrachm from Methymna on Lesbos. A number of Greek bronzes represent boars, although free-standing statuettes are quite rare. A late Archaic or early Classical example at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (10.162), once was attached to the shoulder of a large vessel. This statuette is more likely to have been freestanding, perhaps as part of a hunting group dedicated at a sanctuary.",

     "labeltext": "Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin that has been used for thousands of years to make objects as diverse as sculpture and figurines, weapons and armor, and jewelry and tableware. The addition of tin and sometimes lead made the alloy more versatile and lowered its melting point; another common copper alloy is brass (copper and zinc), which was in widespread use in the Roman period. Although other materials, like stone, glass, and terracotta, were available, copper alloy items were valued for their golden sheen, versatility, and durability. The material lent prestige and beauty to objects like these statuettes, most of which would have been dedicated to the gods. Modern bronzes are often artificially patinated, like the Rodin sculpture in this colonnade. While ancient bronzes were sometimes gilded or deliberately darkened, the unaltered surfaces naturally acquired a red, green, or brown patina over time.",

One of the bodies here -- Lachaise's Woman Bending Backward -- is not from the ancient world, but, like many other European and American works, depends very much on Greco-Roman models and ideals, even as it distances itself from them, for example with a pose not known from representations of women in antiquity.",

Statuette or vessel, funerary offering or object of worship, decorative feature or conscious work of art, they would have elicited very different -- though not mutually exclusive -- responses when seen in their original contexts. Some called for symbolic or religious understanding and were used in ritual, such as the Cycladic figure; others invited their viewers to reconstruct a narrative scenario, such as the Aphrodite binding her sandal; whereas yet others offered visceral aesthetic, sensual, and perhaps even tactile delight. One of the bodies here -- Lachaise's Woman Bending Backward -- is not from the ancient world, but, like many other European and American works, depends very much on Greco-Roman models and ideals, even as it distances itself from them, for example with a pose not known from representations of women in antiquity.",

The figure's forceful body, turned head, and emotional facial features recall works attributed to Skopas of Paros, a Greek sculptor of the fourth century BCE. Similar statues, also associated with Skopas, represent the mythical hunter Meleager with boar's head trophy and dog. As the object under the left armpit is most likely not a hunting spear, this statue probably depicts a different hero, or perhaps a god. It may be a Roman variant of a statue by Skopas, or a Roman work in the style of his time. In Greek fashion, it is composed to be seen in the round, and presents us with a flawless nude male body that is meant to express both physical capability and quality of character.",

     "labeltext": "This cycle is a spectacular example of the convergence of the classical and contemporary in Edo painting. Together, the hanging scrolls create a paradisal garden in which all the seasons flower simultaneously. The theme dates back to the 12th century, when a series of paired birds and flowers were assigned to poetically symbolize each month. These prescribed associations remained prominently embedded in the cultural memory for more than six hundred years. Here, however, HÅitsu has cultivated an alternate set of symbolically charged motifs, creating a vibrant visual idiom for the new era. New motifs include recently imported plants, such as the canna lily from South America, and novel poetic subjects incubated within contemporary short-form haikai (commonly known as haiku) verse. While the paintings are ostensibly secular, research points to their use in Buddhist rituals conducted at the Sakai family mortuary temple in Maebashi, situated about 75 miles northwest of Tokyo.",

     "labeltext": "Two of Japan's most famous peaks--Mount Fuji to the west of Edo and Mount Tsukuba to the northeast--are depicted on the recto and verso of this fan by School of KÅrin painter Suzuki Kiitsu. In the early modern era, Mount Fuji was conventionally depicted snowy white, its summit divided into three peaks. Mount Tsukuba was painted blue with two peaks. Kiitsu wittily takes advantage of the transparency of the fan paper by allowing the silhouette of each mountain to define the form of the other: when held to the light, the snow line of Fuji reveals itself also to be the profile of Tsukuba, painted on the reverse. Similarly, Fuji appears to loom behind Tsukuba, suggesting that the fictive viewing position is Edo itself, safeguarded between the two sacred mountains. ",

Here, Doshin skillfully twists the courtesan's posture to generate a sense of movement and intrigue: she turns her head to look back over her shoulder, but at what, or whom? A petite hand holds up the skirts of her layered robes, revealing an equally delicate foot. This pose, intended to enhance the figure's sensual appeal, was widely adopted by early painters of Yoshiwara beauties. In some of these works, a famous courtesan can be identified; in others, the generic treatment of a woman's appearance serves as a conduit for imaginative appreciation.",

     "labeltext": "Few works embody the convergence of venerable cultural practices and novel pictorial approaches in Edo painting more strikingly than this view of a full moon hovering over reeds. Framed as if seen through a window, the image encapsulates the tradition of moon-viewing, an activity long associated with friendship and yearning: no matter the physical distance separating loved ones, all can look up at the night sky and gaze on the same moon. The enormous archaic seal amplifies this connection to the past. Yet BunchÅ does not simply repeat an established ink-painting theme. The unusual size of the image and Western-style low horizon generate a feeling of \"thereness,\" and the inscription confirms that the work commemorates an actual harvest moon gathering in Edo. By interweaving a singular personal episode with that of countless historical predecessors, BunchÅ creates a \"true view,\" an image rooted not in optical reality but in the subjective experience of a site.

A patch of water bridges the gap between the two screens, compelling unification in the mind's eye. As the birds call to and gaze at each other in the shallow pictorial space, their body language echoes the distinctive coiled ripples inked on the azurite water. Although iconic in its own right, Kiitsu's painting also self-consciously extends an emblem of the School of KÅrin by creatively reprising a crane painting by his master, Sakai HÅitsu (1761- 1828). HÅitsu's painting itself was a reworking of a magnificent pair of crane screens by Ogata KÅrin (1658-1716).",

The fish and turtles moving through the limpid water lapping at the sand bar are rendered with such scientific accuracy that they can be identified as male and female carp, killifish, and minnows. The fish and turtles are painted on one layer of translucent silk and the water on another, mounted behind the first, so that the creatures appear to swim in the moirÃ© of the silk itself. Despite its novelty, however, this illusory aquatic world still operates within the traditional East Asian framework of auspicious painting, in which the combination of fish, turtles, and pines like those growing at the water's edge symbolizes wishes for success and longevity.",

   "labeltext": "In the late sixth century BCE, the northern Indian prince Siddhartha Gautama chose to abandon a life of worldly pleasure. He sought release from the suffering he believed inherent in samsara, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Awakening to an understanding of existential suffering, he became the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, and his teachings, which offered both insights into samsara and a means to escape from it, became the basis of the philosophical and religious system now called Buddhism.\r\nThe religion's earliest adherents believed the Buddha--literally, the \"Awakened One\"--to be a perfected mortal whose exemplary life of right living, proper meditation, and compassion demonstrated the path to awakening. Within three hundred years after the Buddha's death, however, a new form of Buddhism arose. Mahayana Buddhism understood the Buddha as but one of many buddhas and posited the existence of numerous other deities--the most important of which are bodhisattvas, awakened beings who have postponed their release from samsara in order to aid their supplicants. By the first several centuries of the common era, Mahayana Buddhism came to flourish in East Asia, becoming one of the most important creative sources for art and architecture in China, Korea, and Japan.\r\nIn medieval East Asia, Buddhism was often referred to as the \"teaching of images,\" and it was primarily through the exchange of portable images, both painted and sculpted, that the religion was transmitted to the region. In Buddhist ritual practice, painted or sculpted images are treated not as representations of deities but as living deities themselves.\r\nThe works in this gallery are among the finest Chinese and Korean Buddhist sculptures in any American collection. They are drawn largely from the collection of Grenville L. Winthrop (1864-1943), a Harvard graduate of eclectic aesthetic predilections who held a special interest in early Chinese art.",

In fact, many Buddhist monks were renowned for their ability to convert local spirits into protectors of the Buddha's teachings. This figure is one of a pair of universally protective deities known in Chinese as Renwang, or \"benevolent kings.\" Clad in loincloths and scarves, with the fierce demeanors and muscular bodies of Central Asian warriors, they were placed at the gates of East Asian temples to protect the sacred precincts. One member of this pair is depicted with an open mouth, as though pronouncing the Sanskrit syllable ah; the other (seen here), with mouth closed, seems to intone the syllable hum. Like the Greek letters alpha and omega in Christian doctrine, these syllables represent the beginning and end of the cosmos in Buddhist theology. This figure likely would have held a vajra, a scepter signifying omnipotence.",

In the centuries that followed, Korean Buddhists developed their own traditions of ritual practice and systems of philosophical thought, but they were also in constant dialogue with their monastic counterparts in China, exchanging both texts and images. Icons were frequently presented as gifts among the rulers, merchants, and monks of China, Korea, and Japan, which led to a high degree of stylistic cross-pollination across the three cultures. Private, portable icons like these gilt bronze images--which, though crafted in Korea, share many visual traits with similar objects from China and Japan--provided an ideal medium for intercultural artistic and religious exchange. Such images are likely to have been worshipped on small altars in domestic settings. The portable shrine displayed here, from the ChosÅn dynasty (1392-1910), helps us to imagine the original display contexts for the images that surround it. A mobile, self-contained setting for icon worship, it differs little in form, material, or concept from the portable shrines that devotees first brought from India to Central Asia and China centuries before.",

     "labeltext": "Buddhist proselytizers from northern China and Central Asia first entered the Korean peninsula in the final decades of the fourth century. In the centuries that followed, Korean Buddhists developed their own traditions of ritual practice and systems of philosophical thought, but they were also in constant dialogue with their monastic counterparts in China, exchanging both texts and images. Icons were frequently presented as gifts among the rulers, merchants, and monks of China, Korea, and Japan, which led to a high degree of stylistic cross-pollination across the three cultures. Private, portable icons like these gilt bronze images--which, though crafted in Korea, share many visual traits with similar objects from China and Japan--provided an ideal medium for intercultural artistic and religious exchange. Such images are likely to have been worshipped on small altars in domestic settings. The portable shrine displayed here, from the ChosÅn dynasty (1392-1910), helps us to imagine the original display contexts for the images that surround it. A mobile, self-contained setting for icon worship, it differs little in form, material, or concept from the portable shrines that devotees first brought from India to Central Asia and China centuries before.",

In the centuries that followed, Korean Buddhists developed their own traditions of ritual practice and systems of philosophical thought, but they were also in constant dialogue with their monastic counterparts in China, exchanging both texts and images. Icons were frequently presented as gifts among the rulers, merchants, and monks of China, Korea, and Japan, which led to a high degree of stylistic cross-pollination across the three cultures. Private, portable icons like these gilt bronze images--which, though crafted in Korea, share many visual traits with similar objects from China and Japan--provided an ideal medium for intercultural artistic and religious exchange. Such images are likely to have been worshipped on small altars in domestic settings. The portable shrine displayed here, from the ChosÅn dynasty (1392-1910), helps us to imagine the original display contexts for the images that surround it. A mobile, self-contained setting for icon worship, it differs little in form, material, or concept from the portable shrines that devotees first brought from India to Central Asia and China centuries before.",
