# Practice: Finding Information Based on Parameters

In this short practice, you will apply your existing knowledge to complete the
`SingleArticle` component.

## Setup

Clone the starter repo, which you can access through the `Download Project`
button at the bottom of this page.

## Using parameters and passing state to component

In __src/components/SingleArticle/SingleArticle.jsx__, use the parameter given
in the URL to choose the correct article from the `articles` array. (How can you
access the parameter?) Display the information for that article inside the JSX,
replacing the hard-coded information.

Use `useSelector` to load the articles directly from the reducer into the
`SingleArticle` component.

When you've finished, you should be able to see the individual articles as you
click on their respective titles in the "Article List".

## What you have learned
