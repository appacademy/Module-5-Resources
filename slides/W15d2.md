## Redux

- JS framework for managing the frontend state of a web app
- similar to context, but for larger more sophisticated applications
- https://redux.js.org/
- https://react-redux.js.org/



---

## Plan for today...

- talk about the pieces of redux (store, state, actions, reducers, oh my!)
- implement usersState in Patchstagram (first slice of state)
- step through implementing postsState along with short practices (second slice)
- Grocery store long practice  


---


## The process...

## State

- all the information stored by that program at a particular point in time
- prevents us from having to always fetch our data
- similar to what we have used context for (think of the postsContext from last week)


---


## Store

- a single JS object that holds the state of the application
- can have multiple slices as needed with its own actions and reducer
- can provide an initial value for state

```java    
const configureStore = (preloadedState) => {
    return createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancer);
  };
```

---

## Actions

- a POJO with a type property
- they get dispatched (or sent) to the store in response to user actions or fetch requests
- good idea to make the type a variable that points to a unique string for debugging purposes
- Action Creators: functions that return actions and can take arguements allowing the actions to carry payloads of data

```javascript=
export const loadPosts = (posts) => ({
  type: LOAD_POSTS,
  posts
});
```


---

## Reducer

- pure function called each time an action is dispatched
- receives an action and the current state as arguments and returns an updated state.
- always return a new state, never mutate state! 

```java    
const usersReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case LOAD_USERS:
      return {...state, ...action.users}
    default:
      return state
  }
};

```

---

## Middleware / Thunks

- Thunks will be how we handle our calls to our server, they are used to make async API requests
- a Thunks is a general concept in computer science referring to a function whose primary purpose is simply to call another function. 
- We will punt these to tomorrow's lecture topic

---


## Provider

- a wrapper component, providing access to the store to the whole App
- very similar to our provider with context, but takes a store prop instead of value

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
)
```

---

## React-Redux Hooks

### useDispatch

- used to sent actions to the reducer
- this is how we update our state

```java    
const dispatch = useDispatch()

 dispatch(addArticle(newArticle))   
```

---


## React-Redux Hooks cont

### useSelector

- Allows you to extract data from the Redux store state for use in this component, using a selector function.
- has the useState hook built in to it, so when we provide a new ref in memory, it will trigger rerenders
- need to select the key/attribute you want to listen to for change

```javascript=
const articles = useSelector( state => state.articleState.entries)
```

## Lets put it all together for usersState



---

## Practice time!

- pair through first short practice, using params to quesry the store
- 30 min
- we'll come back and talk about it


---


## Practice time again!

- pair through second short practice, using forms with redux
- 30 min
- we'll come back and talk about it


---

## Long Practice time!

- pair through Grocery Store practice
- ask questions!
- tomorrow AM we have the mock assessment on redux
- tomorrow PM we learn about thunks
