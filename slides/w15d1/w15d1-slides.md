## Week 15!
- Day 1 React OG - Class Based Component
- Day 2 Redux
- Day 3 More Redux!
- Day 4 Study Day?
- Day 5 Project Week Starts!

- No assessment on Redux but we have some mock ones

---


## W15D1 Class Based Components

- The original way React was set up
- Back in my day, we had class based components, uphill, both ways
- Something we should know about, because we might see this in the wild




---

## W15D2 Redux

- Global state management
- Seperate framework, does not have to be used with React
- Sort of like context, but made to be used with large scale production applications



---


## W15D3 More Redux (Thunks)

- Will start the day with a mock assessment to make sure we are comfortable with previous day's material
- Lecture in afternoon on Thunks


---

## W15D4 Study Day!

- Another morning mock assessment, adding in Thunks
- Your last chance to ask questions, get help understanding any of the concepts we have learned
- Project starts Friday


---

## Start of Project week!

- We will release and go over the project starter
- Mark Rodriguez will come by for a visit
- Auth me (the project starter) must be deployed by EOD


---


## OG React (Class Based Components)

- React is backwards compatable, so nothing we need to do to use this syntax
- You could see this, refactoring it could be your first job!  



---


## State. or (this.state)

- can still have component state
- still have a state and setState functionality
- state is an object to hold multiple values



---


## Lifecycle Methods 

- useEffect handles these in functional
- componentDidMount() => useEffect with empty dependancy array
- componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) => useEffect with something in the dependancy array
- componentWillUnmount() => return from a useEffect (cleanup)



---


## Rest of today...

- readings & HW practices
- refactoring widgets long practice
- start on your HM if you get done early (there is a lot)
