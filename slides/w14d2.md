## Week 14 Day 2

### How we doing?
- How was homework?
- How are we feeling about React so far?


---

## Week 14 Day 2 Topics

- Vite
- React Basics (review from yesterday's content)
- React Router


---

## Vite!
- Vite is what we will use to build a react front end from scratch
- https://vitejs.dev/
- Vite is only for development!

```terminal
npm create vite@latest <project-name> -- --template react

npm install

npm run dev
```

---


## More Vite Setup - linting

- We want to set up ESlinting for our applications to run automatically
- Lets head to the walkthrough for details (maybe run the below command to start)


```terminal
npm install -D vite-plugin-eslint
```

---



## Lets look at that App.jsx

- its our first component, awwwwwww ðŸ¥º
- lets talk about whats going on, then
- lets clear it out and start building our own app!


---



## Strict Mode

```jsx=
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

- https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode
- helps us find bugs in development (makes sure our components are pure functions)
- when a component mounts, it will cause our components to rerender an extra time 
- it will also cause our effects to run an extra time on mount as well



---


## Patchstagram, an Instagram Clone

![patch](https://res.cloudinary.com/app-academy4/image/upload/v1647291502/Patchstagram/patch_hd_riobbp.png)

- we will build this front end in pieces together over the next 2 weeks
- many of the practices will have some pieces we can relate to our Patchstagram front end
- some practices we will just directly discuss


---

## Components!

- App.jsx is our first!
- Typically we want a component to have its own file
- Capitalized Function
- Returns 1 JSX elemement (1 parent)
- There will be many many more to come...

```jsx
function Post() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2> Post content goes here! </h2>
        </div>
    );
}
export default Post;
```

---

## More on Components

- we need to render/display them somewhere...
- most of the time we will a self closing tag
- its possible to have a component with a closing tag, but not common (usually a wrapper)


```jsx!
import Post from "./components/Post"

function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <Post />
        </>
    )
}
```


---

## Image Tags

- need to set a src attribute (nothing new i know)
- can import the file into the component
```jsx!
import patchImage from "./assets/cat-image.png"

    return (
        <img src={ patchImage } alt="cute-cat" />
    )
```
- can also referece the image name if in the public folder
```jsx
<img src="./cat-image.png" alt="cute-cat"/>
```
- we would use the above syntax if using an external url as well
- don't forget to set an alt attribute!

---

## CSS... (ewww CSS)

- we do need to know how to add css to our components
- if we want to add a file for CSS
```jsx
import "./App.css"

    <img className="main-cat-image" />
```
- generally best to use classes over ids in components
- inline we can use the style attribute, but we need to use double curlies
```jsx
  <img style={{"height": "300px"}} src="..." />
```

---

## Breaktime!
### See ya back in 5 min 
### When we come back, topics will be...

- props
- lists
- events
- routing 

---


## ðŸ™Œ Props! ðŸ™Œ

- we can pass information from a parent to a child component (we can NOT do child to parent)
- we call these props
- they are key value pairs we define on the component where it is called/rendered
- special prop called props.children
- destructing is cool
- spreading works too, but please don't :pray: 


---

## Passing Props

- in the parent...
```jsx
function App() {
    const postTitle = "Check out that cat napping!"
    return (
        <>
            <Post title={ postTitle } />
        </>
    )
} 
```
- in the child component
```jsx
function Post(props){
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>{ props.title }</h3>
        </div>
    )
}
```


---

## Prop Threading (or "drilling")

- passing data down multiple levels of components using props
- it's not "bad" but as our apps grow and the levels of the tree grow, it can be very confusing to pass a prop down 5-8 levels
- there is a better way, where we can skip levels called context, but thats a Thursday thing

![props-drilling](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*l8L4O2GM6tUw1m6fz3FN-g.jpeg)


---

## Wrapper Component

- make use of props.children
- this will be whatever content is between the parents opening and closing tags

```jsx
<PurpleWrapper>
    <OtherComponent />
</PurpleWrapper
```

```jsx
function PurpleWrapper(props) {
  console.log(props)
  return (
    <div style={{"color": "purple"}}>
      { props.children }
    </div>
  );
}
```


---

## Lists 

- we can use our best buddy .map to iterate over an array of data
- need to set a key attribute, this help's react with rendering the list
- like with our component returns, there has to be a single parent returned

```jsx
 { someData.map((postData) => (
    <Post key={ postData.postNum } data={ postData } />
    ))
 }
```


---


## onClick & handleClick (events)

- we handle our event by attributes on the html tag (onCLick, onChange, onSubmit)
- we do not want to invoke our handleClick in the onClick, we need an anonymous function to do it for us


```jsx
  const handleClick = (e) => {
    console.log("in handle click", e.target)
    alert("One day this will help us make a new post...")
  };

 <button onClick={ (e) => handleClick(e) }>New Post</button>
```


---


## React Router!

- its our front end navigation
- lets us decide what "page" to render
- the urls are not the same as your servers urls
- potentially the trickiest thing this week, but also the most important
- will need to install a new dependancy, react-router-dom


---

## Router Setup

- we need createBrowserRouter. which will accept an array of objects
- each object could have a path, element, or children
- we build a tree like structure with potential nested arrays of object
- react handles patterm matching and its pretty awesome (it wasn't always)
```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom" 
const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: '/',
        element: <Landing />
    },
    {
        path: '/posts',
        element: <Feed />
    }
])
```


---

## Router Provider

- sets up where to render out "routes"
- typically found in our App component
- you can't use routing functioniality outside of it (like below, don't do it!)


```jsx

function App() {
  return (
    <>
        <Link to="/posts" ></Link>
        <RouterProvider router={ router } />
    </>
  )
}
```


---

## Navigation

- we use Link tags or NavBar tags depending on situation (is it a navbar? ðŸ˜†)
- we do not want to use <a></a> tags as they will cause an entire page rerender
- NavBars add the "active" class to the link when clicked, allowing for some CSS goodness
- both imported from "react-router-dom"
- Links need to be in the context of our <RouterProvider />

```jsx
import { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'

return (
    <>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <NavLink to="/posts">Feed</NavLink>
    </>
)
 
```

---


## Outlet & Layout

- how we can make navigation components 
- helps us with the context issue from above, we need to have all routing functionality as a child of our <RouterProvider />
- <Outlet /> is imported from "react-router-dom" and is a placeholder for where the Router will render content
- <Layout /> is a convention for the component that handles wrapping other content



---



## Nested Routes

- sometimes our application might require multiple levels of routes
- we can set up children routes on a component
- may need an outlet depending on what you are trying to accomplish
- nested routes HW practice had a great example with Movies & Movie Details...

---

## useParams (our first hook!)

- used for grabbing route parameters
- imported from react-router-dom
- in the router:
```jsx
{
    path: "posts/:postId",
    element: <PostDetails data={ someData } />
}
```
- in the component:
```jsx
const { postId } = useParams()
```

---

## useNavigate

- yet one more tool from react-router-dom
- typically used with an event (onClick or a form submission)
- need to import it and then invoke it

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate()
```
- when we want to navigate to a route...
```jsx
navigate(`/posts/${id}`)
```

## For the rest of today..

### Art Museum Project
- Great long practice for today!  
- Ask questions if you get stuck!
- Start on your HW if you finsih early!
- I would prioritze having homeword completed over doing a bonus phase
