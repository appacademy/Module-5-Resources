## Redux Thunks

- Thunks are function whose primary purpose is simply to call another function
- these will handle our fetches to the server
- they will ultimately dispatch the action creator if they are successful


---



## The process...

![Redux flow chart](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/react-redux/topics/redux/assets/ReactReduxCrudCycle.jpg)



---

## Setup for thunks in store

- need to install redux-thunk (typically already in the package.json already in starters)
- import it in to the store
- addit to our middleware (we need it in production too)

```javascript
let enhancer;
if (import.meta.env.MODE !== "production") {
  const logger = (await import("redux-logger")).default;
  const composeEnhancers =
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
  enhancer = composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger));
}
else {
  enhancer = applyMiddleware(thunk);
}
```


---

## Proxy

- need to tell react where the server is to make fetches
- we add the following to our vite.config.js after the plugins (this is done for you in projects)

```java    
    server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": "http://localhost:5000"
    }
  }
```

---

## Friendly Reminder...
- its been a few weeks since we needed/used a server...
- don't forget you need to start your server and your front end now
- this is a development only thing, in production the client lives in the server


---

## Thunks in the reducer

- function that callsanother function
- we need to pass in the dispatch, so that we can dispatch our action from the thunk
- can have a payload (if its a POST/PUT/PATCH) 

```javascript!
export const getAllUsers = (payload) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/users/all');
  if (response.ok) {
    const { users } = await response.json();
    dispatch(loadUsers(users));
};
```

---

## Thunks - Return vs Dispatching...

- we can do both...
- if we are successful in retreiving or making what we want, it should go to the store & state
- if we got an error, we probably want to return it to the component and display it
- how we do the aboce is going to be situation based on what we are trying to do, and the components we are working with...


---

## API Docs

- there is a markdown file in the patchstagram folder to tell us what we need to know today about the server we are using


---


## Lets get some thunks in Patchstagram...

- get all users thunk (for our login)
- get all posts thunk (cause we need posts)
- create a post thunk (cause we want more posts!)


---


## Practice time!

- pair through the short practice thunk action creator
- pair through the short practice thunk dispatch
- come back for questions
- we will talk about normalizing our state when we come back


---


## Normalizing state

- improves performance!
- objects have constant lookup time, arrays are iterative
- best way would be to send the data already normalized
- use a forEach loop to turn your data from the server into an object
- we can use Object.values to turn it back to an array when needed (for mapping mostly)
- ids as keys is the typical way 


---

## Sample state normalizing

```javascript!
    case LOAD_POSTS:
      const newState = {...state};
      action.posts.forEach((post) => (newState.posts[post.id.toString()] = post));
      return newState;
```


---

## For the rest of today...

- normalizing state short practice(optional, don't do custom selectors if you do try it)
- pet rating short practice from Thursday (especially if you will be cloning AirBnb, but good to know for all)

## Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow will be another self evaluation practice adding in thunks
- Pokedex practice
- Study Day

## Friday starts "Project Week"
