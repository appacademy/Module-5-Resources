## What is React?

- Lets see what the docs say?  https://react.dev/
- "React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components."  

---

### From the HW reading (oh no there was homework???)

- "React is a library that manages the creation and updating of DOM nodes in your web page. It does not do AJAX. It does not do services. It does not do local storage. It does not provide a pretty CSS framework for you. It just dynamically renders stuff into the DOM."


---

## What sites use React? (there are a lot...)
- https://medium.com/@coderacademy/32-sites-built-with-reactjs-172e3a4bed81

## Request / Respose Cycle

![request-reponse-cycle](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*OMhE9T_tuC0pUoZyWKWSnQ.png)

### Lets look at a server...


---

## How does React fit in to this cycle?

- Our Frontend or client lives in our backend or server...
- First request to the server sends react to the browser so we can use it


---

## How does React work?
### Lets draw some happy little trees...

---

## What's this JSX thingy?
-  JavaScript eXtension  JSX
-  Lets us write HTML in our JavaScript files using a dependancy called babel


---

## What is a "React Component"

- function with a title/capital cased name
- must return only 1 JSX element (which looks like HTML)

```jsx
export default function Component() {
    
    return (
        <div>
            Some stuff
        </div>
    );
}
```


---

## Other things about components...

- can have props (parameters)
- can have child components
- most are potentially reusable (prolly not App but most others)
- can have fron end routing, making choices on which components to render
